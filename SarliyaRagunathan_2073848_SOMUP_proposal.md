## Describe the theme or key idea behind your project

The aim of this project is to design and implement a simple synthesiser using SuperCollider that demonstrates fundamental sound synthesis concepts in a clear and minimal way. The project focuses on generating sound using a sine wave oscillator and shaping its amplitude over time using an envelope.

Rather than creating a complex or feature-heavy system, the project prioritises clarity, understanding, and reliability. The synthesiser is intended as a small educational artefact that demonstrates how oscillators, envelopes, and parameter control work together in a real-time audio environment.

## Project research and AI collaboration strategy

The project is informed by introductory sound synthesis concepts and examples commonly found in SuperCollider documentation and tutorials. These resources helped shape the overall structure of the SynthDef and the use of envelopes to control amplitude.

AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, are used as a support tool throughout development. ChatGPT is used to help explain SuperCollider syntax, suggest basic SynthDef structures, and clarify how envelope generators work. AI-generated suggestions are reviewed, tested, and modified by the author to ensure they align with the project goals and the author’s understanding.

AI is used as an aid to learning and problem-solving rather than as a replacement for creative or technical decision-making.

## Project development plan

From a user’s perspective, the software is designed to be simple to use. The user boots the SuperCollider server, evaluates the SynthDef, and then creates Synth instances using different parameter values to explore changes in pitch and amplitude.

The project is developed incrementally, beginning with basic sound generation, followed by the addition of an amplitude envelope and parameter control. The scope of the project is intentionally kept small to ensure the software is stable, understandable, and easy to explain.

### What do you anticipate users to hear?

Users will hear short percussive tones generated by a sine wave oscillator. By adjusting the frequency parameter, the pitch of the sound changes, and by adjusting the amplitude parameter, the loudness of the sound changes.

---

### How will users interact with your software?

Users interact with the software by running SuperCollider code and passing parameters when creating Synth instances. Interaction is text-based rather than graphical, allowing the focus to remain on understanding the synthesis process rather than interface design.

---

### What unique features does your software offer them?

The software offers a clear and minimal example of basic sound synthesis in SuperCollider. Its simplicity makes it suitable as a learning tool and provides a strong foundation for future expansion, such as adding effects, modulation, or user interfaces.

---

### How will you approach AI collaboration during development?

AI collaboration is approached critically and transparently. AI tools are used to support understanding, debugging, and exploration of ideas. All AI-assisted contributions are reviewed, tested, and documented through code comments and reflective writing to ensure academic integrity.
