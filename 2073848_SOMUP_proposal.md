## Describe the theme or key idea behind your project

The aim of this project is to design and implement a simple synthesiser using SuperCollider that demonstrates fundamental sound synthesis concepts in a clear and minimal way. The project focuses on generating sound using a sine wave oscillator, shaping amplitude over time using an envelope, and allowing basic parameter control such as frequency and amplitude.

The intention is to prioritise understanding and clarity over complexity, creating an artefact that is easy to explain, modify, and evaluate. The synthesiser is designed as a small, self-contained sound generator rather than a full performance system.

## Project research and AI collaboration strategy

This project is informed by basic synthesiser design principles commonly found in SuperCollider tutorials and documentation. Existing software synthesisers and educational examples influenced the approach, particularly those that demonstrate oscillators and envelopes in isolation.

AI tools are used as a learning and development aid throughout the project. ChatGPT is used to help explain SuperCollider syntax, suggest initial SynthDef structures, and clarify how envelope generators work. AI-generated suggestions are reviewed and tested manually, and only retained if they align with the project goals and the author’s understanding.

Creative control is maintained by keeping the project scope small and by modifying AI-generated code to suit the specific needs of the project.

## Project development plan

From a user’s perspective, the software is intended to be simple to run and understand. The user boots the SuperCollider server, evaluates the SynthDef, and then creates Synth instances with different parameter values to explore changes in pitch and amplitude.

The project is developed incrementally, starting with basic sound generation and gradually adding envelope control and parameterisation. AI tools are used to assist with understanding specific technical issues, while implementation and testing are carried out manually.

### What do you anticipate users to hear?

Users will hear short percussive tones generated by a sine wave oscillator. By changing the frequency parameter, the pitch of the sound changes, and by adjusting amplitude, the loudness of the sound changes.

---

### How will users interact with your software?

Users interact with the software by running SuperCollider code and passing parameters when creating Synth instances. Interaction is text-based rather than graphical, allowing the focus to remain on understanding the synthesis process.

---

### What unique features does your software offer them?

While the software is intentionally minimal, it offers a clear and educational example of how oscillators, envelopes, and parameter control work together in SuperCollider. Its simplicity makes it suitable as a learning tool and easy to extend in future work.

### How will you approach AI collaboration during development?

AI tools are used to support learning, debugging, and exploration of synthesis techniques. Prompts are refined when initial responses are unclear, and AI suggestions are critically evaluated before being used. All AI involvement is documented through code comments and reflective writing.
